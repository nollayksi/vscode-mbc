# Axway's MBC Language for Visual Studio Code

[**MBC Language**] support extension for Visual Studio Code.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting

## Coming features

* Snipplets
* Building components to .x4

## Using

You will need to install Visual Studio Code >= `1.40.0`. (Probably will work with lower versions, but hasnt been tested)

## Other information

The extension was created as a hobby on my free time and for this reason the development progress for future features will be slow. Even the highlighting might not be prefect yet. 
The extension is open source and anyone up for the task can clone the repository and improve the extension. Repository is located [here](https://github.com/nollayksi/vscode-mbc)
